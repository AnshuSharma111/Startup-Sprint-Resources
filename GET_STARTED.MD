# 🚀 Get Started Guide

Welcome to your **Startup Sprint Workshop**! 🎯  
In the next hour, you’ll turn an idea into a working prototype using AI and no-code tools.

This guide will help you move fast, stay organized, and make something you’re proud of.  
Let’s begin.

---

## 🧩 Step 1: Choose Your Problem

Pick one from the [Problem Basket](./PROBLEM_BASKET.md).  
Discuss quickly with your team - which one excites you most?  

Once you decide, write a one-line statement like:  
> “We’re solving the problem of *[insert your problem here]*.”

---

## 🧠 Step 2: Plan Your Solution

Use AI tools to brainstorm features, workflows, and user experiences.

Try these platforms to explore ideas:
- 🤖 [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com) or [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com) – for ideation & content
- 🧑‍💻 [Claude.ai](https://claude.ai) – for refining prompts or design documents
- 📘 [Bolt.new](https://bolt.new) or [Replit](https://replit.com) – to generate and run code

💬 **Sample Ideation Prompt**

> Students often have trouble tracking classes and deadlines.
> Suggest 3 app ideas that could solve this in under 1 hour of prototyping.
> List possible features, tools, and UI ideas.

---

## 🎨 Step 3: Design Your Interface

Visuals bring your idea to life. You don’t need to be a designer - just give it shape!

Use:
- 🎨 [Figma](https://www.figma.com) – wireframes, UI mockups
- 🧩 [Canva](https://www.canva.com) – fast, template-based design
- 🪄 [Uizard](https://uizard.io) – AI that turns sketches or prompts into UIs

💬 **Sample Design Prompt**

> Design a dashboard interface for [APP NAME].
> Use a [color scheme or theme].
> Include sections for [feature list].
> Style: [flat / modern / minimal / playful].

---

## ⚙️ Step 4: Build Your Prototype

Now it’s time to make it real - even if it’s basic.  
AI tools can write, debug, and deploy code faster than ever.

Try:
- 💻 [Replit](https://replit.com) – instant coding & deployment
- ⚡ [Bolt.new](https://bolt.new) – AI full-stack builder
- 🔗 [Zapier](https://zapier.com) – connect multiple apps (automation)
- 📦 [Glitch](https://glitch.com) – for web app hosting
- ☁️ [Vercel](https://vercel.com) – for quick deployment (optional)

💬 **Sample Build Prompt**

>Create an application named [APP NAME] that is [APP DESCRIPTION].
>The app should contain the following features:
>
>[FEATURE 1]
>
>[FEATURE 2]
>
>[FEATURE 3]
>
>The app should also [APP-SPECIFIC BEHAVIOR, e.g., generate AI summaries or match users].
>
>The UI/UX should follow these rules:
>
>[COLOR THEME / STYLE]
>
>[FONT or LAYOUT]
>
>[INTERACTION STYLE, e.g., tabs, modals]
>
>Finally, add [YOUR UNIQUE TWIST!] - a creative feature that makes your project stand out.

## 🧪 Step 5: Test and Tweak

Run your prototype, click around, and test the flow.  
Ask your AI assistant to fix small bugs or polish design.

💬 **Sample Debug Prompt**
>I built this app, but the 'Add Task' button doesn’t work.
>Here’s the code snippet. Can you identify the issue and fix it?


🧠 *Remember:* AI is great at finding logical gaps - use it as your debugging buddy.

---

## 🎤 Step 6: Pitch It!

End with a 1-minute presentation or demo of your product.

Use:
- 📊 [Gamma.app](https://gamma.app) – generate a 3-slide pitch deck with AI
- 🖼️ [Canva](https://www.canva.com) – create slides fast
- 🧾 [Google Slides](https://slides.google.com) – collaborative option

---

## 🪄 Pro Tips for Teams

✅ Divide and conquer -  
One person prompts AI, one designs, one builds, one documents.  

✅ Keep it small -  
Focus on 2–3 strong features, not 10 unfinished ones.  

✅ Be creative -  
Add a unique flavor: humor, personalization, or animation.  

✅ Document as you go -  
Take notes or screenshots for your pitch deck.
